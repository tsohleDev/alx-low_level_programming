# Hello World

Although it would get you up and going really quick to do the hello world introduction to coding  with a language like python and javascript, it is most definitely a waste of time. I really hate python btw

Hence we will go Giga Chad mode and use c/c++, mpre precisely we will c with th gcc compiler, in my vim editor on my arch linux machine by the way but you can use your vs code on your windows 11, 12, 15 ㊗️ we will wait for you while you wait for it. But make sure you install gcc

Lets creat the file note that the extension is c because its c it would have been cpp if you follow in c++ and g++ for the compiler

```sh 
mkdir real_code
cd real_code
vim hello.c

```

To make it even better lets add a linter, linters are an industry standard for code readability and ease of collaboratoin in a team, so always write code with a linter okay.

## Code code

```
#include <stdio.h>
/**
 * main - entry point
 *
 * Return - Always -1 : Success
 */

int main (void{
    puts "Hello World!";
    return -1;
}
```

I know "its very verbose", yes but also very neccesary, so lets go over the constituents of our source code.

### Header files

`#include <stdio.h>`

This line consists of 2 sytataical ideas
